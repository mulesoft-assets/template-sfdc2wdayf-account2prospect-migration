# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As an admin I want to migrate Accounts from Salesforce to Workday as Prospects.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating accounts from Salesforce, being able to specify the filtering criteria and desired behavior when an account already exists in Workday as Prospect.

As implemented, this template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided into *Input*, *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

During the *Input* stage the template will query all the existing Accounts at Salesforce that match the filtering criteria (in this case being a Prospect Account).
In the *Process* stage, the template queries the Workday for already existing prospects based on the Salesforce IDs retrieved in the *Input* stage.
The accounts get inserted or updated in the Workday system based on the results of these queries.
Lastly, the information about the migration results is sent to pre-configured e-mail recipient and output to the console as well.

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

There are certain pre-requisites that must be considered to run this Anypoint Template. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**



## Salesforce Considerations <a name="salesforceconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Salesforce, in order for this template to work.

In order to have this template working as expected, you should be aware of your own Salesforce field configuration.

###FAQ

### As source of data

If the user configured in the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then a *InvalidFieldFault* API fault will show up.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'

# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get Salesforce to Workday Account-Prospect Migration running.
In any of the ways you would like to run this Template this is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>
<h1>Batch Process initiated</h1>
<b>ID:</b>6eea3cc6-7c96-11e3-9a65-55f9f3ae584e<br/>
<b>Records to be processed: </b>3<br/>
<b>Started execution on: </b>Fri Mar 19 10:08:16 CET 2015
</pre>

## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
In this section we detail the way you should run your Anypoint Template on your computer.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)


### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)
+ Anypoint Studio Project from External Location
+ Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml
+ Mule ESB Configuration XML from External Location

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`


### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**.
Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcaccountmigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdcaccountmigration.cloudhub.io/migrateaccounts` and report will be sent to the emails configured.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during migration, so this is not something to worry about.


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing) which handles all the migration logic.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists of invoking the *defaultChoiceExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is the file where you will find the inbound side of your integration app.
This template has only a [HTTP Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.

**HTTP Connector** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateAccounts` and you are free to change it for the one that you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `0.0.0.0`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* by placing it in the source section of the flow. The response will be the summary of Batch Input stage - number of Accounts loaded by the criteria specified.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Choice Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Choice+Exception+Strategy) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
