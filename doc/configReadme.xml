		<section id="use_case">
As an admin I want to migrate Accounts from Salesforce to Workday as Prospects.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating accounts from Salesforce, being able to specify the filtering criteria and desired behavior when an account already exists in Workday as Prospect.

As implemented, this template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided into *Input*, *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

During the *Input* stage the template will query all the existing Accounts at Salesforce that match the filtering criteria (in this case being a Prospect Account).
In the *Process* stage, the template queries the Workday for already existing prospects based on the Salesforce IDs retrieved in the *Input* stage.
The accounts get inserted or updated in the Workday system based on the results of these queries.
Lastly, the information about the migration results is sent to pre-configured e-mail recipient and output to the console as well.

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcaccountmigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdcaccountmigration.cloudhub.io/migrateaccounts` and report will be sent to the emails configured.

		Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during migration, so this is not something to worry about.

This is the file where you will find the inbound side of your integration app.
This template has only a [HTTP Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.

###  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Connector** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateAccounts` and you are free to change it for the one that you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `0.0.0.0`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* by placing it in the source section of the flow. The response will be the summary of Batch Input stage - number of Accounts loaded by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing) which handles all the migration logic.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists of invoking the *defaultChoiceExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
